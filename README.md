# discord-payloads

This repository contains the payloads of Gateway events and objects of Discord to make testing (or any other implementation) easier for developers.

The goal is to have all event payloads dispatched by the Gateway in this repository, but due to nitro restrictions,
there will be some events that will not be here. Any contribution to add those events (or others) is totally appreciated.

If you have any questions about this repository or want to hang out with us, feel free to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/EVNnW9ZwT2).
